This project is meant to be run in Unreal Engine. There's no provided executable or precompiled binaries.

## Project Overview

This is a large-scale Unreal Engine project that aims to demonstrates various shooting game mechanics and systems. It's an ongoing conversion from Blueprint to C++, so not all systems have been migrated yet.

## Development Status

This project represents an imported codebase that's being progressively converted from Blueprint to C++. As such, you'll find a mix of implementation approaches throughout the project. The codebase will continue to evolve over time as more systems are converted and optimized.

## Features

The project includes implementations of common shooter game elements including:

- Character movement and controls
- Weapon systems
- Enemy AI
- Interaction systems
- Attribute and inventory components
- UI elements

## Notes for Contributors

- Be aware that this is a transitional codebase
- Some systems may still be using Blueprint while others have been converted to also use C++
- Code organization will improve as the conversion process continues
